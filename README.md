## Notes  

While building this app, I encountered a few challenges:  

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Implementing the search bar to dynamically filter games and ensuring the displayed results updated seamlessly without requiring a page reload.  
- **Data Handling:** Parsing and manipulating JSON data to accurately display game details, such as contributions and funding status, in an intuitive and clean manner.  

These challenges helped sharpen my technical skills, particularly in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
